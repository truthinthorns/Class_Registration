# Class_Registration

This is a project that I rewrote in Python. It was originally written in C++ as an end-of-semester project in one of my old classes. It simply creates a student object that can be enrolled/withdrawn from classes, and can have grades, etc. It is a basic representation of what a teacher may see for students.
