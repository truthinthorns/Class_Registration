# Class_Registration

This is a project that I rewrote in Python. It was originally written in C++ as an end-of-semester project in one of my classes. This is something that a teacher may use for their class. The user can enroll/withdraw students, enter grades for them, view seating chart, show students in the class, etc. The student's ID must match the pattern used for the college I was enrolled in at the time of first coding this project. Axxxxxxxx or axxxxxxxx where x=(0-9)
